### Added
- Added missing .meta for THIRD PARTY NOTICES file.

### Changed
- Fixed asmdef to reference UnityEngine.UI (required by TMP)

## [19.1.1] - 2020-05-19
### Added
- Added KSP Part Tools for KSP 1.9.1, from the assetbundle released by Squad.
- Added TextMesh Pro DLLs from the 2017.1 bundle released by Unity. The 2017.1 DLL is required because the Part Tools DLLs are still compiled against the old Unity for some reason.
- Added stub for documentation, to be expanded in future.
- Added licensing, with as much information as is currently available.

### Removed
- Removed Squadcore legacy shaders, might be re-added if they are needed but I think they are no longer meant to be used?
