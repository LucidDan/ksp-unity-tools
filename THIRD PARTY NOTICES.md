Component Name: KSP Part Tools

All files (except the TextMesh Pro files) in the directory "KSPPartTools" are provided by Squad/Take Two, and the original package can be [downloaded here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/160487-parttools-updated/). 

I was unable to track down a specific license, but at least for DLLs, please assume that no rights are granted to reverse engineer or otherwise modify the code, and no other license or rights are granted by being included in this package.

Component Name: TextMesh Pro v1.0.56 (2017.1)

License Type: Unconfirmed, assume Unity Companion License

All files under the directory "KSPPartTools/TextMesh Pro" are provided by Unity, and the original package can be [downloaded here](https://forum.unity.com/threads/useful-information-download-links.458634/#post-3304434). 

I was unable to track down a license for the 1.0.56 version I use here, but v1.2.2 and newer use the [Unity Companion License](http://www.unity3d.com/legal/licenses/Unity_Companion_License).
